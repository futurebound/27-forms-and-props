## Overview
This application is an exploration into using an external API to make HTTP requests and dynamically generate, update, and display data on a page from those requests. The focus is on updating the state of various React componenets, and passing data from parent to child while creating ways for child componenets to update state information on their parent components.

## Getting Started
To get this application up and running, fork and/or clone this repository using the `git clone <git repository link>` command in your terminal. Next, run the `npm install` command, which will install all the necessary dependencies in the accompanying package.json file. If wanting to view tests, enter `npm install -D` into the command line. After those packages have installed, you can run `npm test` to explore the included tests and functionality of their respective solutions. You can open up the code in your favorite editor to explore/modify the code, see how the tests are structured, and create tests of your own if desired.
